<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Quarter ehf. team takes our users’ trust in us extremely seriously. We
know that your data is important to you, therefore we keep it safe and
private.</p>

<p>The EU’s <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR)</a> becomes enforceable on May 25th, 2018, and replaces an older piece of
European legislation. <strong>We are committed to complying with EU regulations.</strong></p>

<h2>Quarter's Roles and Preparedness</h2>

<p>Quarter ehf. is a Data Controller in the sense of the GDPR.</p>

<p>As such, we are responsible for handling your personal data correctly and
ensuring that it is also handled correctly by any 3rd parties we use.</p>

<p>We have ensured that all 3rd parties we use are compatible with the GDPR
and that the necessary Data Processing Addendums (DPAs) are in place. We have
also ensured that all opt-ins are clear and explicit so that we have your
consent for storing your personal information and emailing you, and we have
put in place internal processes for ensuring you can exercise your rights, and
ensuring an appropriate level of security for your data.</p>

<h2>Exercising Your Rights</h2>

<p>As a data subject (i.e., an individual whose personal identifiable data may
be being processed), you have several rights under the GDPR, including the right
to access your data, the right to be forgotten (erased), the right to make
corrections, and more.</p>

<p>To exercise any of these rights, for the time being please email <a href="mailto:info@quarter.is">info@quarter.is</a>
and state which right you would like to exercise, and we will respond with a
confirmation and with the data being requested (if applicable) within the
deadlines stipulated by the GDPR. Over time, we may create automated tools to
help you exercise certain rights, such as the right to data portability, but
these are not ready at the moment, and are significantly complex to create due
to reliance on sub-processors to store some pieces of personal identifiable
data.</p>

<p>In reference to your rights that modify or remove personal data, please note
that we reserve the right to maintain backups up to a period of 30 days. Therefore,
personal data as it existed before correction or removal will remain in the form
of backups for up to this duration after your requested changes are made.</p>

<h2>Status of Our Sub-Processors</h2>

<p>Below is the status on our sub-processors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Mailchimp</strong>: These folks run our newsletter and store our
    list of newsletter subscribers. They are GDPR compliant and
    their terms which we have accepted incorporate a DPA.</li>

    <li><strong>Google</strong>: We use Google to store documents, handle email
    and to perform usage analytics. They are GDPR compliant and
    their terms which we have accepted incorporate a DPA.</li>

    <li><strong>Formspree</strong>: These folks process the form on our front
    page. Our contract with them is GDPR compatible.</li>

    <li><strong>Netlify</strong>: A static website hosting service we use. They are
    GDPR compliant and we have signed a DPA with them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>We take privacy and data protection very seriously. Should you have any
questions about our policies when it comes to data protection and privacy not
addressed here or in our privacy policy above, we will
be happy to answer them as quickly as possible if you email us at <a href="mailto:info@quarter.is">info@quarter.is</a>.
