                <h3>VAT in Iceland</h3>

                <p>
                    As a general rule, those who are selling goods or services in
                    Iceland must declare and pay value added tax (VAT). The rate is
                    normally 24%, sometimes 11%, and must be added to the price of
                    your goods or services before selling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rules also apply to all foreign companies and
                    individuals with revenues originating in Iceland, not only
                    to companies domiciled in Iceland.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box container">
                <h3>Do you need to collect VAT?</h3>

                <p>
                    You most likely need to collect, declare and pay VAT if you have
                    any revenues originating in Iceland. For example if you are a tourism
                    operator visiting Iceland for the summer, or if you come to Iceland
                    to sell any kinds of goods or services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are several exemptions
                    <a href="https://www.rsk.is/english/companies/value-added-tax/" target="_blank">
                        documented by the Icelandic tax authorities
                    </a>.
                    The ones most likely to apply to foreign companies, tourism
                    operators and similar, are the following:

                    <ul class="normal-list">
                        <li>If you sell taxable goods or services for 2,000,000 ISK or less
                            in each twelve-month period.</li>
                        <li>If you are an artist, author, musician or composer.</li>
                        <li>If you are transporting passengers to or from the country (but not within it).</li>
                        <li>If you only ship your goods from abroad to customers in Iceland, and do not have any activities within Iceland itself.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A foreign company or individual will usually require the
                    services of a VAT representative, sometimes called a VAT agent,
                    in order to be able to declare and pay VAT in Iceland.
                </p>

            <div class="box container">
                <h3>What is the process?</h3>

                <p>
                    When collecting VAT, you must add it to your prices before
                    your customer pays, and your invoices should show the amount
                    of VAT broken down to the 24% VAT rate and the 11% VAT rate,
                    as well as your VAT registration number that will be
                    supplied by your VAT representative.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The standard VAT rate is 24%. There is a reduced rate of 11%
                    for several types of goods and services as
                    <a href="https://www.rsk.is/english/companies/value-added-tax/" target="_blank">
                        documented here in detail
                    </a>. The ones most likely to apply to foreign
                    companies are:
                    <ul class="normal-list">
                        <li>Accommodations with a rental period of less than 1 month.</li>
                        <li>Catering and sale of food and alcohol (but note that to sell alcohol you need a special permit).</li>
                        <li>Transportation of passengers.</li>
                        <li>The services of travel agents, tour operators and touring associations.</li>
                        <li>The services of self-employed guides.</li>
                        <li>The sale of books, newspapers, magazines, CDs and similar.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In general, VAT must be declared and paid to the tax authorities six times a year:
                    <ul class="normal-list">
                        <li>No later than April 5th, for income relating to January and February.</li>
                        <li>No later than June 5th, for income relating to March and April.</li>
                        <li>No later than August 5th, for income relating to May and June.</li>
                        <li>No later than October 5th, for income relating to July and August.</li>
                        <li>No later than December 5th, for income relating to September and October.</li>
                        <li>No later than February 5th, for income relating to November and December.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Companies with revenues of less than 4,000,000 ISK in the
                    calendar year can apply to declare and pay just once per
                    year, payable no later than February 5th.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is very steep interest on late payments, therefore a
                    process that ensures VAT is declared and paid on time is
                    very important.
